🚀Day 6/100: Solving Mazes with Python! 🧩

Today, I worked on an exciting project in Reeborg’s World—building a program to navigate a robot through a maze. 
It was a great exercise in applying logic and control structures in Python.

🔑 Project Summary:
This project involves programming a robot to reach the goal in a maze using conditionals and loops. 
The robot evaluates its surroundings with functions like front_is_clear() and right_is_clear() to decide whether to move forward, turn left, or turn right. 
The program ensures the robot can navigate efficiently and adapt to obstacles until it reaches the finish line.

✅ What I achieved:

🔴Wrote reusable functions, like turn_right(), to simplify the logic.

🔴Combined while loops and conditions to guide the robot step by step.

🔴Successfully completed the maze-solving task.

📚Features:

⭐Reusable Functionality: Includes a custom turn_right() function for cleaner code.

⭐Dynamic Navigation: Adapts movements using front_is_clear() and right_is_clear().

⭐Obstacle Avoidance: Smartly handles turns to bypass obstacles.

⭐Goal-Oriented: Ensures the robot keeps moving until it reaches the goal.

⭐Versatile Logic: Works for various maze layouts in Reeborg’s World.
