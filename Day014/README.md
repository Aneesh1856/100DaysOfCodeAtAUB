# 🚀Day 14/100: Higher or Lower Game

As part of my #100DaysOfCodeAtAUB challenge, 
I created an engaging and dynamic "Higher or Lower" game in Python! 🎉 
This program compares two random accounts from a dataset and challenges the user to guess which one has more followers. 
It’s a great way to test intuition while improving coding skills.

🎗️Features of the Program:

🔴Randomized Comparisons: The program pulls random accounts from the dataset, ensuring fresh comparisons every time.

🔴Dynamic Formatting: The output is clean and informative, with account details formatted in a reader-friendly way.

🔴Interactive Gameplay: The user inputs their guess for "A" or "B," and the game evaluates correctness based on the follower counts.

🔴Score Tracking: Every correct guess increases the score, while an incorrect guess ends the game and displays the final score.
