# 🚀 Day 21/100 : Pong Game
Today, I built a Pong game using Python and the Turtle module! 🏓

This was a fun project that helped me understand object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts better.

🛠️ Key Features:

✅ Paddle movement using keyboard inputs

✅ Ball movement and bouncing off walls

✅ Scoreboard tracking points for both players

✅ Game mechanics for scoring and ball resets


The project is structured into multiple Python files for better organization:

🔹 paddle.py - Paddle class to control movement

🔹 ball.py - Ball class for movement, collision, and speed control

🔹 scoreboard.py - Score tracking and display

🔹 main.py - The game loop and logic
