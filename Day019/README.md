# 🚀Day 19/100: Dot Painting using Turtle

Today, I worked on generating a Hirst-inspired dot painting using the Turtle module in Python! 🖌️ The program randomly picks colors from a predefined palette and creates a beautiful grid of colorful dots. 🌈

🏆 What I learned:

✅ Using turtle for graphics

✅ Working with RGB color mode in Turtle

✅ Implementing random.choice() for color selection

✅ Looping techniques for structured patterns
