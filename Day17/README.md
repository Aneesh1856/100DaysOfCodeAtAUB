# 🚀Day 17/100: Coffee Machine Program using the concept of OOP. 

Today, I revisited my Coffee Machine Program and refactored it using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles! 

🛠️ What Changed:

Modularity:
   
🔴Split the code into multiple classes, each with a clear purpose:
▫️CoffeeMaker for managing resources (water, milk, coffee).

▫️MoneyMachine for handling payments.

▫️Menu and MenuItem for managing available drinks and their details.

▫️This separation of concerns made the program more organized and easier to maintain.

Reusability:
   
🔴Encapsulated functionality like resource checking, money handling, and
 menu options into methods.

🔴These classes can now be reused or extended in other projects.

Scalability:
   
🔴By using classes, adding new features (like more drink options or advanced payment systems) becomes simpler and less error-prone.

Readability:

🔴Code is now cleaner, more structured, and easier to understand for others
