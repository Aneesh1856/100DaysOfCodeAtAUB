🚀Day 3/100: Treasure Island

Today, I explored Python by creating a fun and interactive text-based adventure game called Treasure Island 🏝️. 
The game engages players with choices, challenges, and consequences as they navigate through a series of decisions to find hidden treasure.

Highlights of the Program:

🧭 Decision-Making: Players make choices at different stages that shape the storyline.

🎮 Game Flow: Used if-elif-else statements to create multiple outcomes.

✨ User Interaction: Leveraged Python's input() function for real-time engagement.
