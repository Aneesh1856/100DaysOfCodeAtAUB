# 🚀 Day 18/100: Building a Quiz App in Python! 🐍

Today, I worked on a fun project—a command-line quiz application! 
🎓✨ The program asks questions, keeps track of scores, and gives feedback on each answer.

Here’s a breakdown of the project:

🔴 Data Handling:

 🔹All quiz questions and answers are stored in data.py.
 
🔴 Object-Oriented Programming:

 🔹I utilized OOP concepts by creating:
 
   ▫️A Question class (question_model.py) to model each quiz question.
 
   ▫️A QuizBrain class (quiz_brain.py) to manage question flow, scoring, and user interaction.
 
🔴 Main Program:

 🔹In main.py, the app ties everything together—loading questions, initializing the quiz, and running it until all questions are answered.
