# 🚀 Day 15/100: Coffee Machine Program

Today, I worked on a Coffee Machine Program in Python! 
☕️ This project simulates a vending machine that takes orders, checks for sufficient resources, processes payments, and dispenses coffee. 

It's a great way to practice:

✔️ Conditional statements

✔️ Functions and parameters

✔️ User input handling

✔️ Resource management

Key Features:

1️⃣ Calculates change based on coins inserted by the user.

2️⃣ Checks if enough resources (water, milk, coffee) are available for the selected drink.

3️⃣ Displays a report of remaining resources and the profit made.

4️⃣ Handles insufficient resources or payments gracefully.
