# 🚀Day 8/100: Caesar Cipher Program

Today, I worked on building a Caesar Cipher Program in Python! 🐍
This program can encode and decode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a user-specified amount. 
It was a great way to practice string manipulation, modular arithmetic, and user interaction in Python.

💻 Key Highlights:

🔑 Implemented encoding and decoding functionality based on the Caesar cipher technique.

🔄 Added the ability to restart the program, so users can encrypt or decrypt multiple messages in a single session.

🤔 Learned how to handle edge cases, like symbols, numbers, and spaces, ensuring the cipher works seamlessly with any input.
