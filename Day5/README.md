🚀Day 5/100: Password Generator

Today's project focused on creating a Python program that generates strong, random passwords based on user preferences. 
In a world where online security is vital, this tool can help ensure passwords are strong and unique!

💻 How It Works:

1️⃣ Users input the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.

2️⃣ The program randomly selects characters from predefined lists of letters, symbols, and numbers.

3️⃣ It shuffles the characters to ensure randomness and then combines them into a final password.

📚 Key Concepts Learned:

🔴Using the random module to generate random choices.

🔴Iterating with loops to construct dynamic lists.

🔴Shuffling lists for added randomness (random.shuffle).
