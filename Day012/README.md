# 🚀Day 12/100: Number Guessing Game

🎯 Today, I worked on a fun project - a Number Guessing Game! 
It's a simple console-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100.

👨‍🏫 How It Works:

1️⃣ The program randomly picks a number.

2️⃣ The user selects the difficulty:

 Easy: 10 attempts
 Hard: 5 attempts
 
3️⃣ Based on the user’s guess, the program provides feedback:
“Too high” or “Too low”

Tracks the remaining attempts until the correct number is guessed or attempts run out.

🛠️ Skills Practiced:

🔴Conditional logic

🔴Functions with parameters

🔴Random number generation with randint()

🔴Code readability and user interaction
