# 🚀 Day 16/100: Tic Tac Toe Game

🎮 Today, I built a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python! 

This classic game allowed me to reinforce my understanding of:

✅ Working with 2D lists.

✅ Implementing control flow for turn-based games.

✅ Writing reusable functions for clean and modular code.

💡 Here's what the program does:

1️⃣ Prints the game board dynamically after each move.

2️⃣ Alternates turns between two players ('X' and 'O').

3️⃣ Checks for a winner across rows, columns, and diagonals.

4️⃣ Handles invalid moves gracefully.

5️⃣ Declares a draw if all spots are filled without a winner.
