# 🚀Day 10/100: Simple Calculator🧮

💻 Today’s milestone in my coding journey was creating a fully functional calculator program in Python! 
This project not only solidified my understanding of Python fundamentals but also helped me explore interactive programming concepts. 
Here's a closer look at what I achieved

🛠️ Features of the Calculator Program

1️⃣ Basic Arithmetic Operations:
The calculator supports four essential operations:

🔴Addition (+)

🔴Subtraction (-)

🔴Multiplication (*)

🔴Division (/)

2️⃣ Interactive Workflow:
The program allows users to chain calculations, meaning you can continue with the result of the previous operation.
If desired, users can also reset and start a new calculation seamlessly.

3️⃣ Functional Programming:
Each operation is defined as a function, making the code reusable and modular.
A dictionary maps operation symbols (+, -, etc.) to their respective functions, streamlining the logic for computation.

The calculator function implements a loop that:

🔴Displays available operations to the user.

🔴Continuously prompts for inputs until the user decides to stop or restart.

🔴Calculates and displays results dynamically.
